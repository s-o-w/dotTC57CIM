	/// Limit based on most restrictive series equipment limit.
	/// A specification of  of equipment that determines the calculated operational
	/// limit values based upon other equipment and their ratings.  The most
	/// restrictive limit connected in series within the group is used.   The physical
	/// connection based on switch status for example may also impact which elements in
	/// the group are considered. Any equipment in the group that are presently
	/// connected in series with the equipment of the directly associated operational
	/// limit are used.   This provides a means to indicate which potentially series
	/// equipment limits are considered for a computed operational limit. The
	/// operational limit of the same operational limit type is assumed to be used from
	/// the grouped equipment.   It is also possible to make assumptions or
	/// calculations regarding how flow might split if the equipment is not simply in
	/// series.
