	/// <summary>
	/// An unordered enumeration of phase identifiers.  Allows designation of phases
	/// for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads.   The
	/// enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together
	/// or connected to ground.  Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.
	/// Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or
	/// split-phase, secondary circuits. For the example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer
	/// to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral
	/// wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits
	/// may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-
	/// phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
	/// The integer values are from IEC 61968-9 to support revenue metering
	/// applications.
