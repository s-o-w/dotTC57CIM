namespace TC57CIM.IEC61970.Base.Domain {
	/// <summary>
	/// The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit
	/// is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived symbol is used
	/// instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol Farad
	/// is defined as "F" instead of "CPerV". In cases where a standard symbol does not
	/// exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol.
	/// For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented
	/// as "kgPerm3". With the exception of the "kg", which is an SI unit, the unit
	/// symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore represent the base derived
	/// unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole.
	/// Every unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-
	/// letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying
	/// descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.
	/// To allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring special
	/// character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from the
	/// format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol "/" is replaced by the
	/// letters "Per". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit as "m3"
	/// instead of being formatted as "m" with a superscript of 3  or introducing a
	/// symbol as in "m^3". The degree symbol "°" is replaced with the letters "deg".
	/// Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the
	/// description for the unit symbol.
	/// Non-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to
	/// be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that
	/// is reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This allows
	/// software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw
	/// data of those sources into SI-based units.
	/// The integer values are used for harmonization with IEC 61850.
