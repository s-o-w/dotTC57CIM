	/// <summary>
	/// A PowerTransformerEnd is associated with each Terminal of a PowerTransformer.
	/// The impedance values r, r0, x, and x0 of a PowerTransformerEnd represents a
	/// star equivalent as follows.
	/// 1) for a two Terminal PowerTransformer the high voltage (TransformerEnd.
	/// endNumber=1) PowerTransformerEnd has non zero values on r, r0, x, and x0 while
	/// the low voltage (TransformerEnd.endNumber=2) PowerTransformerEnd has zero
	/// values for r, r0, x, and x0.  Parameters are always provided, even if the
	/// PowerTransformerEnds have the same rated voltage.  In this case, the parameters
	/// are provided at the PowerTransformerEnd which has TransformerEnd.endNumber
	/// equal to 1.
	/// 2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the three PowerTransformerEnds
	/// represent a star equivalent with each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x,
	/// and x0 values.
	/// 3) For a three Terminal transformer each PowerTransformerEnd shall have g, g0,
	/// b and b0 values corresponding to the no load losses distributed on the three
	/// PowerTransformerEnds. The total no load loss shunt impedances may also be
	/// placed at one of the PowerTransformerEnds, preferably the end numbered 1,
	/// having the shunt values on end 1.  This is the preferred way.
	/// 4) for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the
	/// PowerTransformerEnd impedance values cannot be used. Instead use the
	/// TransformerMeshImpedance or split the transformer into multiple
	/// PowerTransformers.
	/// Each PowerTransformerEnd must be contained by a PowerTransformer. Because a
	/// PowerTransformerEnd (or any other object) can not be contained by more than one
	/// parent, a PowerTransformerEnd can not have an association to an
	/// EquipmentContainer (Substation, VoltageLevel, etc).
