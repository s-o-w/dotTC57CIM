	/// An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or
	/// without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric
	/// circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active
	/// power flow).
	/// A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not
	/// be identical.
	/// A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for
	/// use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer
	/// typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more
	/// terminals.
	/// The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.
	/// The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.
