	/// <summary>
	/// Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system
	/// quantity such as voltage or flow.
	/// Remote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal
	/// located at some place remote from the controlling equipment.
	/// The specified terminal shall be associated with the connectivity node of the
	/// controlled point.  The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used
	/// in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for
	/// tap changers.
	/// For flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow
	/// out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
	/// The attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in
	/// the following cases:
	/// - For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to
	/// specify maximum and minimum power factor values;
	/// - Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap
	/// changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and
	/// the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the
	/// voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore
	/// wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is
	/// typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in
	/// normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a
	/// target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.
	/// The attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related
	/// to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative
	/// of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local
	/// substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the
	/// power flow from move the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used
	/// regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue.
