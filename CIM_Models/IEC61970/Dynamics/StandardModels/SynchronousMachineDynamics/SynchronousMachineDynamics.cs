	/// <summary>
	/// Synchronous machine whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard
	/// model expressed in one of the following forms:
	/// - simplified (or classical), where a group of generators or motors is not
	/// modelled in detail;
	/// - detailed, in equivalent circuit form;
	/// - detailed, in time constant reactance form; or
	/// <font color="#0f0f0f">- by definition of a user-defined model.</font>
	/// <font color="#0f0f0f">It is a common practice to represent small generators by
	/// a negative load rather than by a dynamic generator model when performing
	/// dynamics simulations. In this case, a SynchronousMachine in the static model is
	/// not represented by anything in the dynamics model, instead it is treated as an
	/// ordinary load.</font>

	/// Xp</i> etc. are actually used as inductances in the models,</font> but are
	/// commonly referred to as reactances since, at nominal frequency, the PU values
	/// are the same. However, some references use the symbol <i>L</i> instead of
	/// <i>X</i>.</li>
