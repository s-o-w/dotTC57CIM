	/// <summary>
	/// There are often stages of power which are associated with stages of cooling.
	/// For instance, a transformer may be rated 121kV on the primary, 15kV on the
	/// secondary and 4kV on the tertiary winding. These are voltage ratings and the
	/// power ratings are generally the same for all three windings and independent of
	/// the voltage ratings, there are instances where the tertiary may have a lower
	/// power rating.
	/// For example, for three stages, the power rating may be 15/20/25 MVA and the
	/// cooling is OA/FA/FOA. The 15 MVA rating goes with the OA cooling (Oil and Air
	/// cooling). This is called the self cooled rating as there are no external
	/// cooling enhancements. The 20 MVA rating goes with the FA cooling (Forced Air
	/// cooling), this means that when the fans are running and thus enhancing the
	/// cooling characteristics, the transformer can operate at a power level of 20 MVA.
	/// The 25 MVA rating goes with the FOA cooling (Forced Oil and Air cooling), this
	/// means that when the fans and pumps are running and thus enhancing the cooling
	/// characteristics even more than before, the transformer can operate at a power
	/// level of 25 MVA. This 15/20/25 MVA does not state how the power is split
	/// between the various windings. It may be 25 MVA input on the primary, 25 MVA
	/// output on the secondary and 0 MVA output on the tertiary. It may also operate
	/// at 25 MVA input on the primary, 17 MVA output on the secondary and 8 MVA output
	/// on the tertiary.
