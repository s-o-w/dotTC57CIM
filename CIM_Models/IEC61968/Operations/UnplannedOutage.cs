	/// A unplanned outage may be created upon:
	/// - impacts the SAIDI calculation
	/// - a breaker trip,
	/// - a fault indicator status change,
	/// - a meter event indicating customer outage,
	/// - a reception of one or more customer trouble calls, or
	/// - an operator command, reflecting information obtained from the field crew.
	/// Outage restoration may be performed using a switching plan which complements
	/// the outage information with detailed switching activities, including the
	/// relationship to the crew and work.
